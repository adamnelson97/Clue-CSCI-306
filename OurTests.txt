For the doorways tested, we picked the corner rooms:
Kitchen has a door facing DOWN
Ballroom has a door facing LEFT
Master Bedroom has a door facing UP
Library has a door facing RIGHT
Then, we picked cells from the other five rooms:
Conservatory has cells with no doors
Art Room has cells with no doors
Trophy room has cells with no doors
Theatre has cells with no doors
Servant Quarters has cells with no doors

Then we tested a cell from each room to check for the right initial.
